                            Bending sound, lost in my circle, dredging the ocean<br>
                            Here am I, flashing no color tall in my room overlooking the ocean<br>
                            Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth<br>
                            There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station<br>
                          
                            Once there were mountains on mountains<br>
                            Once there were sun birds to soar with and once I could never be down<br>
                            I got to keep searching and searching<br>
                            Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?<br>
