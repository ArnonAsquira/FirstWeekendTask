                 He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters.
                His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.<br>

                Born in Foosha Village, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber. He also met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who owned and gave Luffy the very Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday.
